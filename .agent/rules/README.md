´´´ NOTES
Rules are passive constraints. They are always "on" (or triggered by file type) and are injected into the system prompt to govern behavior. Use Rules for things the agent must always do, like "Always use TypeScript strict mode" or "Never commit secrets." They restrict the how of every task. They are the guardrails of the system.
