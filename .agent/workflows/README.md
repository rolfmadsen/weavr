``NOTES
Workflows are active, user-triggered sequences. A workflow is a saved prompt or set of steps that the user explicitly invokes (e.g., /test or /review). They are useful for manual orchestration, allowing developers to trigger complex, multi-step processes with a single command. They are the macros of the agentic world.
